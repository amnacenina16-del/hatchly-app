MODELS FOLDER
=============

PUT YOUR TRAINED ML MODEL HERE

Instructions:
-------------
After training your model (in prawn_ml_training folder):

1. Copy the trained model file:
   prawn_ml_training/models/latest_model.h5

2. Paste it here and rename to:
   prawn_model.h5

The Flask app expects:
models/prawn_model.h5

Without this file, predictions will return dummy data.
