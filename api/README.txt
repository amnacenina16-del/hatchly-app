API FOLDER
==========

This folder is reserved for future API modules.

Currently, all API endpoints are in app.py

If you want to organize your code better, you can create
separate Python files here for different API routes:

Example structure:
- api/auth.py      (authentication routes)
- api/prawns.py    (prawn management routes)
- api/predictions.py (prediction routes)

For now, everything works from app.py directly.
